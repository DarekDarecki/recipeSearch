# recipeSearch
Simple Node.js app consisting of 4 miniapps:
1. Simple dictionary-based lemmatization of polish words
2. Node.js recipe scraper (polki.pl - sorry about that)
3. Search engine itself and Facebook Messenger API client to communicate with user - working example you can find [here](https://www.facebook.com/Szybkie-przepisy-317977181931573/?fref=ts)
4. Basic website which shows given recipe details (works properly only on 1440x782 & < 991px resolutions)
